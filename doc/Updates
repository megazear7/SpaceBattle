>>> Weapons? how does this work?
The players issue a command such as "weapons fire xxx" where xxx is the name of a weapon. Ships have a list of weapons. A weapon is a class.
If xxx is in the players list of weapons then the Weapons system class gets the stats of the weapon with that name that the origin ship has.
A weapon class has damage, damageType, name, and more as the game rules change / advance.

>>> Movement and facing
A ship can face in one of 16 directions. in this way your arcs are your current facing +/- 2.

>>> USER INPUT IDEA
Turn Based to start with: 	Make a game loop that continually runs, and every pass through it issues a command to the ship, which in turn issues 
							a command to that ships input mechanism, which in turn gets the command either from a user, or a AI or something, 
							the that command is issued to the BattleController.

Real Time:	A game loop runs and on ever y pass through it takes a list of commands from the ships and issues them. Input sources type commands
			which are put on this stack in the ship which, on the next game loop pass through (which is very fast) the command is issued.
			This basically is the action / listener type of thing. Needs to modeled after that basically.

Each system now has one function. Now the framework is done.
Need to decide on how to track the position and facing of ships
	Idea: The BattleController has "position" that is always at 0,0 and a "facing" that is always facing foward. And then use a 12 oclock
	System for determining facing. In this way (6, 8, 3) would mean that ship is 6 spaces to the right of origin, 8 spaces ahead and facing
	3 oclock. In this way every ship could be translated on a grid, and there would be no need to limit the grid bounds. Ships could get set with
	starting positions that make sense, say (0, -10, 12) and (0, 10, 6) and then these ships could go from there. Utility functions that helped
	with figuring out if say, "Is there a ship withen 6 spaces ahead of me?" or other useful to ask questins.
Need to decide on the rules to the game. Damage, shields, engines, sensors, ect... How damage is calculated, how energy is used ect...
	This may take some time to think and plan out, this is where the game is either fun or boring, use star strek lingo and scientific jargon
	for coming up with system, action and argument names. Probably working on fleshing out the framework, making Junit tests, and implementing
	the spacial tracking might come first so that I can figure out a good system of game rules that will be fun.

>>>Need to design the system of what exactly a command means, what it is, how they receive a meaning in the first place, what it effect and 
how:

There will be a class called BattleController that will determine which system the command needs to be routed to. This means give the action, 
arguments, origin data and target data to the system class (named after the system name) This class will take in the parameters and manipulate 
the ships that are passed into it. The key here is that the system classes are the classes that can manipulate ships. Additionally a EnviroEffect
object is passed back to the CommandResponse and then back to the BattleController. In this way the BattleController can track information about 
the changing enviroment due to the actions of the ships.
|
the EnviroEffect object is basically a data object and the BattleController object uses it to effect the "playing area". 

Whenever a ship (i.e. a Ship object) issues a command it sends that command to its BattleController. The controller receives the command.
The BattleController has a list of Ship objects as parameters. Whenever a command is issued the BattleController processes the command in 
the way described above and applys all the changes to any ships that need changed. In this way a turn based system, real time system, count
up system or really such system could be used.

>>>Need to make a gui that takes in user input, as well as displays some data such as health, energy and stuff. Maybe a command
such as, "sensors scan foward" would tell you where the enemies are.
