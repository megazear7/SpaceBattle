commenting and documentation as well as well defined game rules.

make a gui that is fun and intuitive. Enter button to send commands, console style input, HUD of all sorts of information.

make computer AI

Make a gui tool that can be used to create ships.

Lastly I need to make one gui which takes you to all of these things (like a main menu that brings all of this together)

From there I can work on doing things such as making levels, a campaign and stuff
